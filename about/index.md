**{% include name %} is a chorus in the Seattle area with a focus on contemporary music.**

Artemis is the goddess of the hunt, of animals and wilderness, of the moon and archery. Artemis of the wildland is our patron for her renowned skill, her strong will, and her role as protector.

{% include name %} exemplifies this as a chorus through our skill as singers, our will in mastering the music before us, and our roles as shepherds of a safe space. We are a semi-professional chorus focusing on modern and contemporary

## Our Music

{% include name %} focuses on modern and contemporary music without being afraid to reach back into the past for those pieces which inspire the music of today. The music we perform with be difficult to sing, and we trust that the audience will enjoy what we have to offer --- or, failing that, that they will appreciate the music and the singers on their merit.

Here is a selection of some of the works we have shared or will share:

* Frank Martin --- *Mass for Double Choir* and *Songs of Ariel*
* Luigi Dallapiccolla -- *Il coro dei malammogliati*
* Imant Raminsh --- *Ave Verum Corpus*

{% include name %} also works with composers young and old to showcase new music. This takes the form of composition competitions and through direct contact with composition organizations and schools. Here are some of the composers we've featured:

* Madison Scott-Clary (yes, she's the conductor, but she gets a pass)

## Our Space

{% include name %} was created out of the need for a musical group which accepts all comers and provides a welcoming space for them. Just as we more than welcome our music transgressing artistic boundaries, we more than welcome our members transgressing social boundaries. {% include name %} as a group aims to be a platform for all voices.

* **Singing while trans is fraught.** {% include name %} welcomes folks from all along and outside of the gender spectrum. Concert dress is left up to the performer within reasonable bounds, as the singer's expression belongs to them, not the audience, group, or conductor.
* **Singing as a person of color comes with its own expectations.** {% include name %} rejects the pristine whiteness of so many other choirs and explicitly welcomes people of color to banish that stereotype.
* **Singing while young is unfortunately gendered.** {% include name %} welcomes young singers of quality to help put to rest the tired expectation that singing is for girls.
* **Singing while disabled is more difficult than it ought to be.** {% include name %} strives to work with singers to provide an accessible and comfortable space to those with disabilities, both for rehearsal and performance.
